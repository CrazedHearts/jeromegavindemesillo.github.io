<h1>
  My Experiences
</h1>

So far, TypeScript is a lot similar to Javascript, except that it tries to be different.  In a way, it feels a little more complicated.  Having starting college in 2021 and my first language being Java, it did feel like a lot compared to when I learned C and C++ a bit later, but I feel like Java is only a good first language when learning and understanding code fundamentally.  However, I haven't touched Java for a couple years, and having to go back to it was okay.  However, trying to learn TypeScript felt like a challenege because I wanted to write the code in Java, but its supposed to be TypeScript.  I haven't formally learned Javascript in a class before, so trying out the exercises felt a bit strange because of how similar it felt to code in Java vs JavaScript.  

How I remember printing something out in Java:
```
system.out.println("Hello World");
```
But printing something in Javascript:
```
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
So it felt a bit strange having to go over Javascript for the first time, mind you I haven't touched Java since 2021.

In a way, you can look at Javascript and TypeScript the same way as you look at C and C++.  They're both familiar in a way, but different in some. For example:
Javascript
```
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(add(5, 3)); // 8
console.log(add("5", 3)); // "53" ← no error, but might be unintended
```
TypeScript
```
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(5, 3)); // 8
// console.log(add("5", 3)); // ❌ Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```



Personally, I do see TypeScript being good in a Software Engineering perspective.  I can see it being a good use for developing thing formally.  TypeScript could be good in athletic software engineering, assuming by the name, it might be a bit challeneging but I can see if people would want to use the language in an athletic sort of way.  

I did find the practice WOD's to be very useful, mainly because I'm a slow coder usually and having the practice helps a lot, practice in general just helps a bunch.  I do like this style of learning, it lets me go at my own pace, it can be stressful if and only if I don't understand something right away.

I asked ChapGPT to give me the Javascript and TypeScript code snippets as my examples.
