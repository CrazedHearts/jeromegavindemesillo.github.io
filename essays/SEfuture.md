I'm super exciting for what I'm about to learn and create in this class.  I've taken a Video Game Design class and actually made a working game with a group of people who I now call me friends.  Taking that class further interests me into developing more, and I'm super excited to learn.  This website is a great example, I never knew GitHub could do something like make a website.  I've made websites before, like in High school, but that was all though Google Sites, so it was a lot easier to just upload images and put text.  Making this very website is very exciting to me because of the way its supposed to be made, I actually feel like I'm developing something.

Some skills and experiences that I hope to develop in the future is probably leaned more toward Game Development or anything like that.  I've been a video game enjoyer for a long time, and getting to experience the video game making process was super fun!  It probably was more fun to me because I got to work with a group of people as well, and I think I just hope to experience making more things whether it be by myself or with a group again. 

We decided to use Unity as our game engine to make our game, and I had ZERO experience in using Unity AND GitHub at that point.  So learning that we could use GitHub to push our code and changes for our games made things feel a lot easier and why GitHub is pretty important for our field.  Moving on to working with Unity having zero experience, it was a pretty fun learning experience overall.  I remember mainly a LOT of YouTube tutorials, but once you have a basic understanding of what you wanna do and stuff, it was pretty smooth sailing.
